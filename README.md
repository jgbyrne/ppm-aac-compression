An implementation of Prediction-by-Partial-Matching statistical data compression with Adaptive-Arithmetic-Coding.
One of my favourite pieces of coursework from my Computer Science degree.

**A message to current students:** this is free software, but please respect your institution, your lecturers, and the integrity of your own degree by not plagarising this work. I encourage you to read the paper `Practical Implementations of Arithmetic Coding' by P.G. Howard and J.S. Vitter (1992) if you are struggling with PPM/AAC.
